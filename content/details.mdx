### Scale to zero, defined

When a Neon compute endpoint hasn't received any connections for a specified amount of time, it will [autosuspend](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/auto-suspend). This is helpful in two ways:

-  **Resource Management** - No stress about turning off databases. It's automatic.
- **Cost-Efficiency** - Never pay for database compute that's not serving queries.

But the part that takes _"we turned the database off for you"_ from bug to feature is starting it back up quickly when needed... That's why cold start times are so important.

#### How Neon optimizes cold start speed

Neon keeps a certain amount of empty computes "pre-warmed" in compute pools to ensure that when a user's database needs to start, most of the work is done already. More technical details are available in the article: [cold starts just got hot](https://neon.tech/blog/cold-starts-just-got-hot).

## When to use scale-to-zero databases

Look at the cold start times documented above and decide: _In what scenarios is the occasional `575ms` delay acceptable?_

The answer may depend on the specifics of your project, but here are some example scenarios where many users find scale to zero useful:

- **Non-Production Databases** - Development, preview, staging, test databases.
- **Internal Apps** - If the userbase for your app is a limited number of employees, the db is likely idle more often than active.
- **Database-per-user Architectures** - Instead of having a single database for all users, if you have a separate database for each user, the activity level of any one database may be low enough that scale to zero results in significant cost reduction.
- **Small Projects** - For small projects, configuring the production database to scale to zero can make it more cost-efficient without major impact to UX.

And remember German Escalators: Don't let anyone tell you that scale to zero makes a database unfit for production.

## Cold Start FAQs

If your questions aren't answered below, [ask in the Neon Discord](https://neon.tech/discord).

### How often will my users encounter cold starts?

That depends on two factors: (1) how long you've configured the compute to wait before autosuspending, and (2) the pattern of activity on the database.

Imagine a project configured to autosuspend after five minutes of inactivity (the default), the number of cold starts experienced in a day is equal to the number of gaps in activity greater than five minutes.


### How do cold starts affect usability?

For end-users, a cold start will add _[AVG Cold Start Time]_ millisecond delay to the response time of the first query to hit a suspended compute. In a web application that may result in part or all of a page taking _[AVG Cold Start Time]_ milliseconds longer to render.

### Does the Serverless Driver affect cold starts?

The benchmarks above use the standard [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) driver (AKA `pg`) to connect to Neon.
Neon also provides a [serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) that allows users to connect to Neon from serverless environments over HTTP or WebSockets.

While the serverless driver was originally created for environments where TCP is not available, it works everywhere.
And, the optimizations made in the serverless driver to reduce the back-and-forth roundtrips required to initiate a connection may actually cut your cold start time by 10-50 milliseconds.


### Are cold starts longer for branches?

No. [Database branches](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/branching) are a core primitive in Neon.
They work a lot like git branches:
You can create a branch of your database at its current state or any other point in its history.

When you create a branch, a new, separate compute endpoint is started up to query it. Here's a secret: **Even the main database is a branch,** so cold starts for new branches are exactly the same as cold starts for everything else on Neon databases. It's branches all the way down!

In fact, this benchmark operates by [creating several branches with varying schema]() and testing cold starts on each.

### Are start times longer for creating databases?

No. When a user first creates a new database project on Neon, the platform runs the same cold start on a new empty database.

### Does database size affect cold start time?

The [500 MB](#500MB) above cold starts a database with 500MB of data, you can compare the times to the rest of the benchmarks to determine how use of extensions affect load times.

### Do extensions affect cold start times?

The [Extensions benchmark](#Extensions) above loads 60 Postgres extensions, you can compare the times to the rest of the benchmarks to determine how use of extensions affect load times.

## Benchmark methodology

To gather real-world cold start times, the benchmark uses a Neon project with a separate [database branch](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/branching) for each of the above variants. A [serverless function](https://github.com/ruf-io/neon-cold-start/blob/main/setup/index.js) executes the following steps every 30 minutes:

1. Check that the database is autosuspended
2. Connect and execute a SQL query on the database, forcing it to start.
3. Log the total response time from before connection create to after response received.
4. Suspend the database.

### Calculating Results

The cold start duration for every benchmark run is saved in a table.
To calculate the results, results are fetched and the [`simple-statistics`](https://simple-statistics.github.io/) library is used to calculate P50, P99, and Standard Deviation of results.

The code where the results are calculated can be found [here](https://github.com/ruf-io/neon-cold-start/blob/main/hooks/index.tsx#L126-L134).

### Benchmark Code

All code for the benchmark and display of results is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ruf-io/neon-cold-start/blob/main/setup/index.js) Here is a snippet showing how the timing of the cold start is measured:

```javascript
// Run benchmark
const before = new Date(); // <-- Start Timer Here
const benchmarkPool = new Pool({
  host: benchmarkEndpoint.host,
  password: benchmarkRolePassword,
  user: ROLE_NAME,
  database: DATABASE_NAME,
  ssl: true,
});

await benchmarkPool.query(benchmarkQuery);
const after = new Date(); // <-- End Timer Here
const benchmarkValue = after.getTime() - before.getTime();
benchmarkPool.end();
```

## Try It Yourself

Sign up for the [free Neon account](https://neon.tech), clone the repo for this benchmark and website: [Neon Cold Start Repo](https://github.com/ruf-io/neon-cold-start) and you can run and modify the benchmarks yourself.
Follow the developer docs in the repo to get started.

Keep in mind that benchmarks run locally will include the roundtrip latency from your device to AWS datacenter. The cold starts from this page are deployed in a Lambda in the same AWS region as the Neon database.
